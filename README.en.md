# ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-2.8

English | [中文说明](./README.cn.md)

## Overview

ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-2.8 is a resource package for an ESP32-C6 based 2.8-inch touch LCD development board. This repository includes Arduino examples, ESP-IDF examples, factory firmware, schematics, mechanical files, SD card demo assets, and GUI Guider UI resources for quick hardware evaluation and application development.

This package is intended for:

- Verifying ESP32-C6, LCD, touch, sensors, SD card, and audio functions.
- Building touch LCD applications with Arduino or ESP-IDF.
- Reusing BSP, LVGL examples, and GUI Guider projects for UI development.
- Checking hardware schematics, mechanical dimensions, and factory firmware resources.

## Hardware Overview

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| MCU | ESP32-C6-WROOM-1 |
| Wi-Fi | 2.4 GHz only; 5 GHz is not supported |
| Display | 2.8-inch LCD, 240 x 320 resolution |
| LCD driver | ST7789 |
| Touch controller | CST3530, I2C address `0x58` |
| IO expander | CH32V003, I2C address `0x24` |
| Sensors | QMI8658 6-axis IMU, PCF85063 RTC, SHTC3 temperature and humidity sensor |
| Storage assets | Micro SD card demo assets and SPIFFS audio demo |
| UI framework | Arduino examples use LVGL v8.4.0; ESP-IDF examples use LVGL v9 |

> CH32V003 is used for IO expansion, LCD reset, touch reset, and backlight control. Its control firmware is pre-programmed at the factory. In normal use, only the ESP32-C6 application needs to be flashed.

## Arduino Quick Start

Recommended environment:

- Arduino IDE
- `esp32 by Espressif Systems v3.3.10`
- Board selection: `ESP32C6 Dev Module`

Steps:

1. Install `esp32 by Espressif Systems v3.3.10` from Arduino IDE Boards Manager.
2. Select `ESP32C6 Dev Module` from `Tools` > `Board`.
3. Copy the bundled libraries to the Arduino libraries directory:

   ```text
   example/Arduino-v3.3.10/lib/lvgl
   example/Arduino-v3.3.10/lib/SensorLib
   ```

   The default Arduino library directory on Windows is usually:

   ```text
   C:\Users\<UserName>\Documents\Arduino\libraries
   ```

4. Open an `.ino` example from `example/Arduino-v3.3.10/example`, then build and flash it.
5. It is recommended to run `01_exio` first to verify the CH32V003 IO expander before testing LCD, touch, and sensor examples.

### Arduino Examples

| Example | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01_exio` | CH32V003 IO expander test |
| `02_I2C_qmi8658` | QMI8658 6-axis IMU test |
| `03_SD_Card` | SD card read/write test |
| `04_I2C_pcf85063` | PCF85063 RTC test |
| `05_shtc3` | SHTC3 temperature and humidity sensor test |
| `06_lvgl_demo` | LCD, touch, backlight, and LVGL basic UI test |

## ESP-IDF Quick Start

Recommended environment:

- ESP-IDF v5.5.4
- Target chip: `esp32c6`

Enter any ESP-IDF example directory and run:

```powershell
idf.py set-target esp32c6
idf.py build flash monitor
```

### ESP-IDF Examples

| Example | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01_ch32_test` | CH32V003 IO expander test, mainly observed through serial logs |
| `02_2048` | LVGL-based 2048 touch mini game |
| `03_sd_lvgl` | SD card text reading and LVGL display |
| `04_sd_music` | MP3 playback from SD card |
| `05_spiff_music` | MP3 music player demo using SPIFFS assets |
| `06_wifi_weather` | Wi-Fi weather demo |
| `07_Ball_qmi` | QMI8658 motion-controlled ball demo |
| `08_bookesia` | Brookesia / drawing-board style touch application demo |

## SD Card Assets

The `sdcard/` directory contains test files, images, and audio assets used by the examples. For SD-card-related demos:

- Use a Micro SD card of 64 GB or smaller.
- Format the card as FAT32.
- Copy the files from `sdcard/` to the SD card root as required by each example.
- `04_sd_music` requires a `music` folder and `.mp3` files in the SD card root.

## Factory Firmware

The factory firmware is located at:

```text
Firmware/ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-2.8-FactoryApp.bin
```

It can be used to restore or verify the factory demo. Before flashing it, make sure the serial port, target chip, and flash settings are correct.

## Development Notes

- For common UI changes, start from the application layer, LVGL pages, GUI Guider generated code, or example business logic.
- Avoid changing BSP, low-level drivers, pin definitions, or partition tables unless the hardware connection or board design has changed.
- If LCD or touch does not work, verify CH32V003 communication first.
- The Arduino `06_lvgl_demo` example already adapts ST7789 and CST3530, so an extra GFX display library or third-party touch library is usually not required.
- The ESP-IDF BSP has already adapted LCD, touch, backlight, audio, sensors, and CH32 IO expansion.

## Notes

- Select `ESP32C6 Dev Module` for Arduino projects.
- The Arduino example folder is designed for `esp32 by Espressif Systems v3.3.10`.
- The `ESP-IDF-V554` folder is designed for ESP-IDF v5.5.4.
- CH32V003 firmware is pre-programmed at the factory and does not need to be flashed separately.
- ESP32-C6 supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only; 5 GHz Wi-Fi is not supported.
- For the weather demo, prepare an internet-connected Wi-Fi hotspot according to the example configuration.
